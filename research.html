                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This qualitative study aimed to explore and gain in-depth understanding of the experiences of nurses in dealing with student nurses using Husserl’s phenomenological approach and Collaizi’s method of qualitative data analysis. Purposive sampling was used to select six nurses from a public hospital in Cebu. A series of semi-structured interviews were done for data gathering until data saturation was reached. Their experience relates to the phases of perioperative nursing which yielded three essential themes: Pre-Op: Self Preparation, Intra-Op;Teaching and Learning, and Post-Op: Nursing Hope. The first essential theme, Pre-Op: Self Preparation, refers to the preparation done by these nurses to themselves before interacting with student nurses. This preparation includes mental conditioning, knowledge review and skills reassessment. Intra-Op: Teaching and Learning, the second essential theme, highlights the nursing view dealing with student nurses as a chance for them to teach and mentor, just like the actual operation that adjusts, to help them develop into the greatest nurses they can be. The last theme, Post-Op: Nursing Hope, relates to the hopes of the nurses towards student nurses. In addition to providing excellent patient care, nurses aspire to develop and mentor student nurses, passing down the knowledge and empathy necessary for success in their future positions.This hope includes for them to learn from their mistakes and to become the best version of themselves. The findings reveal that nurses who interacted with student nurses relate their experience as a perioperative process in a surgical approach. Preparing themselves, implementing what they prepared for, and hoping for the best after the encounter.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study explores transgender visibility in nursing education and its potential to represent sexual minorities in higher education while shaping sensitive policies for trans students. Despite increased visibility due to progressive ideals, transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals still face societal challenges within various systems, even with growing allyship. Conducted in select non-sectarian nursing schools in Cebu City, the study employed a descriptive phenomenological design with specific inclusion criteria for participant identification. Key informant interviews were conducted, and raw audio data were transcribed, analyzed using Colaizzi’s thematic analysis technique and NVivo 10. The findings revealed the real-life experiences of trans-woman nursing students (TNS), leading to five salient themes: “Raising My Flag,” “Ohana Means Family,” “Navigating Campus Climates,” “Ally or Adversary,” and “The Care I Provide.” These experiences underscore their resilience amidst structural obstacles, emphasizing the need for greater diversity in educational institutions, clinical settings, and society. Both positive and negative encounters highlight the necessity of a more accepting culture that affirms the identities of TNS, enabling them to thrive personally and professionally through validation and respect.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified burnout among healthcare workers, adversely affecting patient health and safety outcomes. This meta-analysis quantifies the effect size and examines the relationship between healthcare worker burnout and patient outcomes through a comprehensive review of studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, following PRISMA guidelines. The Hunter and Schmidt method was used to calculate weighted effect sizes, interpreted using Cohen’s model. After a rigorous selection process, seven studies were chosen from an initial pool of 265, each presenting diverse correlating variables and coefficients. The analysis found a weighted effect size of r = 0.3508, indicating a moderate positive correlation, particularly between emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and adverse patient outcomes. Despite the limited number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria, the findings emphasize the harmful effects of burnout on patient care, stressing the urgent need for interventions to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This research evaluates the efficiency of the "Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko" medical mission program in supporting the Nursing Community Extension Services (NCES) by identifying its strengths and weaknesses. Titled "The Medical Mission Program of Nursing Community Extension Services of CIT-University: A CIPP Evaluation," the study examines the collaboration between CIT University and Barangay Labangon as part of the university’s commitment to community service. Using Stufflebeam’s CIPP Evaluation Model, data was collected through heterogeneous purposive sampling, including interviews with NCES officers and coordinators, analysis of existing documentation, and surveys of medical mission recipients. Findings show the program relies on resources from sponsors, partners, volunteers, and medical supply donations, operating on the first and third Saturdays of each month under NCES and Barangay Labangon’s supervision. Free consultations are the most in-demand service, with cough-related illnesses being the most common health concern. The program also enhances recipients' medical knowledge and alleviates financial burdens. Overall, "Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko" has significantly improved community health by providing accessible medical care, removing financial barriers, and enhancing participants' well-being and quality of life, effectively fulfilling its objectives.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The increasing number of pregnancies among women over 35 reflects a global trend of delayed motherhood, with advanced maternal age posing higher risks of pregnancy complications, including congenital defects that affect both the child and parents. While medical research on congenital defects is extensive, little is known about the lived experiences of older first-time mothers. This phenomenological study explored how these mothers cope with raising a child with a birth defect through unstructured interviews with five primiparous women of advanced maternal age. Using Van Manen's lifeworld existential framework, the analysis examined emotional and behavioral responses (lived body), the journey from diagnosis to advocacy (lived time), daily challenges (lived space), and the role of support networks (human relations). Despite significant difficulties, findings revealed that the mother-child relationship was characterized by deep love, resilience, and personal growth. Ultimately, the study highlights how adversity can strengthen family bonds and underscores the need for supportive environments to help these mothers navigate their complex realities.
